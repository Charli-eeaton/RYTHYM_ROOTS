# üéµ Root Note üéµ

Root Note is a rhythm-based adventure game created during the Global Game Jam 2023 @ Bristol. Developed in just 48 hours, it follows the musical journey of a tree growing through the four seasons, guided entirely by the player‚Äôs sense of rhythm.

Players must tap to the beat, using the four directional keys in time with the music to nurture and evolve the tree. Each season introduces new musical themes, visual changes, and rhythmic patterns, offering a fresh and immersive challenge. From the blooming vibrance of spring to the quiet stillness of winter, your sense of timing is what breathes life into the tree.

As you successfully sync with the beat, the tree blossoms, transforms, and reaches towering new heights‚Äîoffering a satisfying feedback loop of audio, visual, and gameplay progression through the seasons before a challenging end at winter.

With a completely original soundtrack, art, and code, Root Note was designed to blend nature‚Äôs beauty with the pulse of music. Root Note offers a unique, seasonal journey through sound and growth.


## üéπ Custom Engine & MIDI Integration

To streamline development and enhance replayability, we programmed a custom rhythm engine capable of parsing MIDI files and converting them into playable beat maps. This allowed for rapid prototyping and seamless syncing of user input with musical cues, laying the foundation for tight, music-driven gameplay.
